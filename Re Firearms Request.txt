⠀⠀Hello, Tyler Fergason. We have received your... [italic]numerous[/italic] letters about your [italic]“need for self defense”[/italic] and how you will [italic]“single-handedly protect the station from threats.”[/italic]

⠀⠀In preparation of the arrival of such a [italic]strong, fierce warrior[/italic] onto the Eden station, we have coordinated with the previous shift’s crew on leaving you an [bold]extremely powerful, highly experimental weapon.[/bold]

⠀⠀The weapon is hidden in a secret location behind the station’s Chapel. When you arrive, head into the maintenance tunnels near the Chapel entrance. There should be a sign for [bold]“[color=Gold]Solars[/color]”[/bold] next to the door.

⠀⠀From there, follow the High Voltage wire West until you see an orange electrical locker. Head South, then West, until you see an Air Canister.

⠀⠀Directly South from the Air Canister, you should notice an imperfection in the wall. Move the fake wall out of the way, and behind it is the weapon.

⠀⠀Again, this weapon is an [bold]extremely powerful prototype.[/bold] The [italic]utmost[/italic] care should be taken when using this, but we trust someone as [italic]passionate and vulgar[/italic] as you with this responsibility to the fullest extent.
[bolditalic]
Godspeed, Soldier.[/bolditalic]
