# The-Eden-Files
A collection of forms made specifically for the Eden map on [Funky Station](https://funkystation.org/).

NOTE:
The `# text label` seen at the top of every file is a Document Label, it will automatically label the document when the document is printed via a fax machine.
PLEASE remove the label and the line its on if you are not printing the document ingame but rather pasting it ingame.
